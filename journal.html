	<p> 10/2 so far in making this website i have completed my person card and have started my website but have not finished it yet. in comp sci so far ive learned multiple different codes and how to expand off of those codes. for instance the p code is an abbreviation that means paragraph and allows you to type a paragraph in the code. there are so many different codes in comp sci and i want to learn more about them. </p>

	<p>
		10/15 what is a variable? a variable is a code that can keep and store other codes inside of it.

		what is a function? a function is a code that is used for action. for instance a function could move an apple on a screen from side to side. you can make a function move by making a variable inside of your javascript and then make a setinterval which tells you the time the objects are going to be placed.

		10/21 the next code that i made involved my favorite basketball player. i worked on this project with my fellow peer ollie. we made a function and included all of the codes needed for the function to work. which includes the addEventListener. the addEventListener sees the code and makes it so that the image will change into another image just by clicking on the screen. then we made a setInterval and then the code was finished. the final project was multiple pictures of basketballs turning into one of my favorite nba players.

		11/14 today in class i learned how to change a photo just by one click. first you have to make two variables in the script section with one being the links to the photos on the web and the other varible being the names of the photos. next the addEventListener allows for the photos to change on the click. then below the variables and the addEventListener and enter the codes var random = Math.floor(Math.random()*10), box.style.backgroundImage = pics[random], and click2.innerText = schools[random] to allow for the pictures to change on the click.

		11/20 in class today we worked on thanksgiving codes. i decided to have a cartoon turkey being chased by a cartoon knife. to do that, i put a image of the turkey and an image of the knife in the style section and also made a div for both of the codes. then i made an animation and keyframes code. both of these codes allow for the images to move simultanouesly throughout the website. then in the keyframes section i made the images rotate. and after that the code was finished.

		2/13 i finally finished making my data rep. it took a while because of some few minor mistakes and now its working perfectly. i made a div and a container for each of my songs while also making audio files for each of them. i then added an eventlistener to make the song play on the click. i also added little boxes also triggered by the eventlistener for my code to play a song and also show the little boxes on the same click.

		2/28 i am almost finished with my family project. i am going to try and make the photos rotate around 
	</p>

	<p>
		3/7 i just finished my present to my family and i am going to show them during spring break! i had 4 images and had them rotate around my screen. pretty simple, but also pretty effective.

		3/10 here are my ten questions:
		1. how do you use a variable as a counter?
		2. what is appendChild?
		3. what is the difference between writing and running a function?
		4. how do you make pictures fade away or become transparent in codesketch?
		5. how do you make to pictures spin around at the same time?
		6. what does console.log actually do?
		7. what does Math.random actually do?
		8. are there different ways to run a function?
		9. is it possible to make pictures progressively get bigger and smaller?
		10. what do strings do?

		4/10 today i finished my game which included the gecco from geico and a sound that i found hilarious. i made a div that has the gecco from geico and i put an mp3 sound in my code. the gecco duplicate and move around the screen and if you would click on one of the geccos then you would hear the sound. it was a fun code to make and i hope we do something like this in the future.

	<p> so far in making this website i have completed my person card and have started my website but have not finished it yet. in comp sci so far ive learned multiple different codes and how to expand off of those codes. for instance the p code is an abbreviation that means paragraph and allows you to type a paragraph in the code. there are so many different codes in comp sci and i want to learn more about them. </p>
